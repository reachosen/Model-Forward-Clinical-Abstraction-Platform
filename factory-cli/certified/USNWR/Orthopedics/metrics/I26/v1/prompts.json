Delays to definitive fixation can increase pain, length of stay, and risk of complications such as malunion or limb length discrepancy. Clinical reviews should ensure timing and method of treatment are appropriate for the child.\n      \n      RISK FACTORS:\n      - Prolonged traction or temporizing care without clear reason\n- Delayed OR related to system issues rather than clinical need\n- Use of fixation techniques not aligned with age/weight norms\n- Inadequate follow-up imaging leading to late recognition of malalignment\n      \n      REQUIRED QUESTIONS:\n      - Was definitive management chosen according to age and size guidelines?\n- If OR timing exceeded 18 hours, is the delay clinically justified?\n- Were alignment and length assessed on follow-up imaging?\n- Was pain control adequate while waiting for definitive treatment?\n      \n      OUTPUT FORMAT:\n      Return a JSON object with:\n      - \"eligible\": boolean\n      - \"met_metric\": boolean\n      - \"safety_flags\": string[]\n      - \"clinical_reasoning\": string\n    ",
