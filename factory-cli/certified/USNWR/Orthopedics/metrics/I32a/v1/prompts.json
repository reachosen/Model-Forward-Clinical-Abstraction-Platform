Clinical review can identify gaps in perioperative care and discharge planning.\n      \n      RISK FACTORS:\n      - Incomplete SSI prevention bundle or prolonged operative time without antibiotic re-dosing\n- Inadequate pain control or bowel regimen leading to readmission\n- Technical or hardware issues requiring early revision\n- Insufficient discharge teaching or follow-up planning\n      \n      REQUIRED QUESTIONS:\n      - Was the full SSI prevention bundle documented for AIS fusion?\n- Is the reason for readmission or return to OR clearly categorized (infection, GI, hardware, pain)?\n- Was this return to OR documented as planned vs unplanned?\n- Were discharge instructions and follow-up appointments clearly documented?\n      \n      OUTPUT FORMAT:\n      Return a JSON object with:\n      - \"eligible\": boolean\n      - \"met_metric\": boolean\n      - \"safety_flags\": string[]\n      - \"clinical_reasoning\": string\n    ",
