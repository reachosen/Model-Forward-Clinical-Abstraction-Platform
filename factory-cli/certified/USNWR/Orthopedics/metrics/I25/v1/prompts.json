The real goal is to balance timely decompression and reduction with safe conditions (experienced team, appropriate timing) rather than blindly chasing an 18-hour clock.\n      \n      RISK FACTORS:\n      - Ischemic (white/cool) hand with delayed operative management\n- Missing or incomplete pre-operative neurovascular exam documentation\n- Unnecessary after-hours surgery performed mainly for metric performance\n- Missed or late recognition of compartment syndrome warning signs\n      \n      REQUIRED QUESTIONS:\n      - Was a complete neurovascular exam documented before surgery?\n- Was the hand perfusion status (pink/warm vs white/cool) clearly described?\n- If time to OR exceeded 18 hours, is there a clear, clinically justified reason?\n- Were compartment syndrome red flags documented and acted upon promptly?\n      \n      OUTPUT FORMAT:\n      Return a JSON object with:\n      - \"eligible\": boolean\n      - \"met_metric\": boolean\n      - \"safety_flags\": string[]\n      - \"clinical_reasoning\": string\n    ",
