Immediate surgical intervention was deemed necessary, and the patient entered the operating room at 11:30, resulting in a delay of 1.5 hours.

The assessment revealed signs of anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) palsy, as indicated by his inability to make the 'OK sign'. Neurovascular examination showed intact pulses, and importantly, no signs of compartment syndrome were noted. The surgical team prioritized the case, and the patient was taken to the operating room at 19:00, leading to a delay of 2 hours from arrival. The delay was attributed to a busy OR schedule rather than any clinical instability.",
