Upon examination, he was noted to have a Gartland type III supracondylar humerus fracture on the left side with a pink, pulseless hand. Neurovascular assessment revealed no movement in the fingers, and the AIN motor exam was not able to be performed due to the absence of finger flexion. The patient was kept under observation, and surgery was scheduled for Sunday at 09:00. The delay from injury to surgery was approximately 13 hours. There were no signs of compartment syndrome documented during the assessment, and the surgical team was notified promptly about the neurovascular status. The family expressed concern about the long wait for surgical intervention.",
