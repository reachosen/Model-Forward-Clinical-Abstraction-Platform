Initial assessment revealed a Gartland II supracondylar humerus fracture with a pink pulseless hand. Neurovascular examination indicated no motor function in the radial nerve distribution, yet documentation inconsistencies were noted regarding the time of injury and assessment findings. The patient underwent surgery at 22:00 the same day, resulting in an 8-hour delay. Despite the pulseless hand, no signs of compartment syndrome were documented, raising concerns about the adequacy of the neurovascular assessment. The surgical team noted a significant delay in intervention due to the conflicting notes regarding the patient's status and initial presentation, ultimately concluding that this case is a clear fail due to documentation gaps.",
