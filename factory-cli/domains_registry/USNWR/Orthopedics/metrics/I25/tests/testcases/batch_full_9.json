On examination, the patient demonstrated signs of anterior interosseous nerve (AIN) palsy, as he was unable to perform the 'OK sign' with his right hand. Neurovascular assessment revealed a pulseless hand, and there were no signs of compartment syndrome noted upon initial evaluation. The decision for surgical intervention was made, and the patient was taken to the operating room at 20:30, resulting in a total delay of 2.5 hours from arrival. The surgical team documented that the fracture was classified as a Gartland II. Post-operative plans included monitoring for potential neurovascular recovery.",
