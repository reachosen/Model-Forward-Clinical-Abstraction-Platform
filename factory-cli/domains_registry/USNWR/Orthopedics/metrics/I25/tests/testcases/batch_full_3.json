The patient exhibited a clear pass in neurovascular status with no signs of compartment syndrome noted during the examination. The surgical team was notified, and the patient underwent surgery at 15:30, which was a 1.5-hour delay from the target initiation time, but no significant complications arose from the wait. The patient's postoperative course was unremarkable, and he was scheduled for follow-up in one week.",

Upon examination, a pucker sign was noted, indicating potential significant soft tissue injury. The patient was not taken to the operating room until 09:00 on Saturday, leading to a 10-hour delay in surgical intervention. The delay was primarily attributed to the unavailability of surgical staff during the night and a lack of OR capacity.
