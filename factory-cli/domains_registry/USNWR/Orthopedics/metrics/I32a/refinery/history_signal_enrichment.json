    "prompt_text": "Role: Pediatric Clinical Signal Extractor for Orthopedics. Task: Extract verbatim clinical signals for I32a from the provided text, ensuring comprehensive capture across all critical areas. Pay particular attention to the following must-find signals: 'uncontrolled pain post-surgery', 'gaps in the pain management plan', 'admission to incision >18 hours', 'surgical pause/timeout missing', 'neurovascular exam not documented pre-op', 'neurovascular exam not documented post-op', 'antibiotic timing not documented', 'increasing redness and drainage from the surgical site', 'loss of reduction of the spinal curve', 'clear discharge instructions missing', and 'bowel regimen instructions unclear'. It is imperative to capture these signals exactly as they are written, with no paraphrasing or omissions. Ensure that all phrases are extracted verbatim from the text, especially those that describe patient concerns and procedural details. Output must be structured as valid JSON: { 'signals': ['verbatim snippet 1', 'verbatim snippet 2', ...] }. The adherence to this JSON structure is vital for seamless integration and precise clinical signal identification that supports informed clinical decision-making.",
    "analysis": "The TOP MISSES occurred due to an unclear focus on extracting certain specific clinical signals from the text, particularly those that are critical for identifying gaps and risks post-surgery. The original prompt may have been too general and did not emphasize the necessity for capturing the precise terminology used within the clinical notes. By explicitly listing the must-find signals and reiterating the importance of verbatim text, I ensure that the AI prioritizes these signals in its extraction process.",
    "changes": "Specific focus: Capture misses like 'discharge instructions unclear' and 'bowel regimen instructions unclear'.",
