However, upon review, it was discovered that the discharge instructions were not clearly documented, leading to confusion regarding follow-up appointments. The patient presented to the emergency department with uncontrolled pain and was readmitted due to a surgical site infection. The lack of clear discharge instructions and follow-up plans could have contributed to the readmission, highlighting a vital gap in patient education and continuity of care.",

      "patient_payload": "A 15-year-old female underwent anterior spinal fusion for idiopathic scoliosis. Despite a well-planned operative procedure, there was a significant delay in administering the full SSI prevention bundle. The pre-operative checklist indicated that antibiotic prophylaxis was not documented within the required 60 minutes prior to incision. Post-operatively, the patient developed signs of infection, including wound erythema and drainage. A review of the surgical notes revealed no documentation of the neurovascular exam pre-op and post-op, which raises concerns about compliance with infection prevention protocols. This situation underscores the need for thorough documentation and adherence to the SSI prevention bundle to mitigate future complications.",
