You are helping a clinician quickly review this case. Using only the patient payload, generate 5–10 short, case-specific follow-up questions.

Rules:
- Focus on what is missing, unclear, conflicting, or delayed.
- Do NOT ask about general policies, protocols, training, or system design.
- Anchor questions on these themes when present:
{{signal_group_list}}

Now analyze:
{{patient_payload}}
